### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Here is who I am:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at **Nord-Image** as a web developer, working with wordpress, php, js, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to become a **designer & developer of applications**.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects, with my humble knowledge.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything regarding web dev or drawing and animating :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @IrisDessine on Twitter, and pretty much everywhere (insta, fb) except here where I'm Eithliu :)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Her/She
- âš¡ Fun fact: I draw my life in a comic strip, and especially my professional reconversion! It's here => [Iris Dessine](https://irisdessine.blogspot.com) (and it's in french, for now, maybe I'll translate it in english, someday ^^)
