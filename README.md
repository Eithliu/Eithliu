### Hi there 👋


Here is who I am:

- ✔️ Fullstack Dev for [Pix](https://github.com/1024pix) : JavaScript, VueJS, HapiJS, NodeJS, EmberJS, ...
- 🔭 I worked for 16 months at **Nord-Image** as a web developer, working with WordPress, PHP/Laravel, JS/VueJS/VueX. 
- 💻 I have knowledge on software architecture, API's (REST or GraphQL), NodeJS and so on...
- 🌱 I have a diploma as a **designer & developer of applications**.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, with my humble knowledge.
- 💬 Ask me about anything regarding dev or drawing and animating :)
- 📫 How to reach me: @IrisDessine on Twitter, and pretty much everywhere (insta, fb) except here where I'm Eithliu :)
- 😄 Pronouns: Her/She
- ⚡ Fun fact: I draw my life in a comic strip, and especially my professional reconversion! It's here => [Iris Dessine](https://irisdessine.blogspot.com) (and it's in french, for now, maybe I'll translate it in english, someday ^^)
- Will definitely work on **Unity 3D** and **C#** for my own games
